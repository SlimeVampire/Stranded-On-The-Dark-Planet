# Pack Description
Stranded on the Dark planet is your typical Haxon pack with a bit of a spice to it. Adding features from the abandoned pack "Emfylios" to the basic idea of  "Stranded on Earth". This pack has a lot to offer, from an immersive progression and 90% custom world gen. Offers a fun experience to even the most experienced players as you struggle to survive in a desolate wasteland doomed for failure. On top of a super dark wasteland you have to deal with super deadly organic like robots. A nice feature is that as you play and progress it will be harder and harder to survive and keep your base in tact.
